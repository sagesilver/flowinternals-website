          <h2>Use Case Summary</h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>This very simple workflow shows how to build a simple submit form for a recruitment user to add the name, resume and job role a candidate has applied for - which is subsequently saved to Onedrive and a record updated in Microsoft Excel.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Whilst not really practical in a real-world scenario, this simple flow uncovered some great lessons for me in implementing Microsoft nodes and was my first flow using n8n Forms.</p>

              <li>Staying in TEST mode, Form Title = Submit Application, Form Description = optional (appears on the form so you can add instructions if you like)</li>
              <li>Add the following form elements (fields):
                <ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0.5rem 1.5rem;">
                  <li>Field Name: Name, Type=Text, Placeholder blank), check Required on</li>

            <h3>Node Configuration</h3>
            <ul class="step-list">
              <li><strong>1. Trigger Node</strong><br>
                This node serves as a form trigger, initiating the workflow when a new application form is submitted. It is configured to listen for form submissions and triggers the workflow upon receiving new application data. The settings include specifying the form to monitor and any authentication required to access the form service. In the workflow, this node acts as the starting point, processing the submitted application data and passing it on to subsequent nodes for further processing.</li>
              
              <li><strong>2. Save to Onedrive Node</strong><br>
                This node is responsible for saving the submitted resume to OneDrive as part of the job application process. It interacts with the Microsoft OneDrive API using the provided authentication credentials. The settings include the folder path where the resume should be saved and the name of the file. Once the resume is saved, the node outputs the file metadata, which can be used by subsequent nodes in the workflow.</li>
              
              <li><strong>3. Get OneDrive URL Node</strong><br>
                This node performs an HTTP request to retrieve the URL of a file from OneDrive. It interacts with the OneDrive API using the provided authentication credentials and takes input parameters such as the file ID or name. In the workflow, it is used to fetch the URL of a specific file from OneDrive, which is then used as input for subsequent nodes.</li>
              
              <li><strong>4. Save Application Record to Excel Node</strong><br>
                This node saves the submitted job application data to an Excel file. It interacts with the Microsoft Excel service to create or update the specified Excel file. The settings may include authentication details, file path, and data mapping configurations. In the workflow, it receives the job application data, processes it, and then saves it to the Excel file. The output is the updated Excel file, which can be used by subsequent nodes for further processing or storage.</li>

            <ul class="step-list">
              <li>Make sure your mapping of parameters between the OneDrive and Save to Excel are correctly mapped</li>
              <li>When testing - if you have 2 monitors - have n8n on one monitor and OneDrive and Excel in split-screen mode on the second. That way you can see the file and record saves in real time</li>
              <li>If you make changes to your workflow, make sure to SAVE your work before attempting the next test/run. There is no auto-save in n8n yet</li>
            </ul>

              <p><strong>OneDrive Tip:</strong> In the Onedrive node, I wrote the file to the Onedrive root directory (Parent ID = root). However if you want to write to another folder - you need to find that folders id (it won't work if you just put in the folder name or path). To find that id - open the folder in Onedrive online view and grab it from the URL. If you can't identify it - give the whole URL to ChatGPT/Claude and ask it to extract it for you. Then put that into the Parent ID field). Note that it can take some time for the file to appear due to sync speed. Note that if you change to a folder you will also need to change the next node (Get OneDrive File URL) to also retrieve from that folder.</p>
